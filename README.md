## Extra Schedulers extension for Forge Stable Diffusion webUI ##
*experimental branch*
**more samplers**
***more schedulers***
*but are they any good?*

see also: https://github.com/MisterChief95/sd-forge-extra-samplers for some others that I've haven't implemented here to avoid duplication (though there still is some). For example: Extended Reverse-Time SDE sampler, RES multistep ancestral.
